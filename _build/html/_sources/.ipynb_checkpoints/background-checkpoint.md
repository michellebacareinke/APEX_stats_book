# Part II. Background

The following background is recommended before starting this module:

1. **Stats concepts in your course.** This module will work best if you have already covered the relevant module topic in your course. You may want to review your notes or textbook before starting this module.

2. **APEX Code Modules** Key concepts needed to complete the [APEX Stats Modules](https://github.com/vectrlab/apex-stats-modules#readme) effectively (i.e., interpret results and for practical application to similar problems in the future).

### Learning Outcomes

These reviews below and accompanying code exercises map onto several learning objective(s) for the C-ID descriptor for [Introduction to Statistics](https://c-id.net/descriptors/final/show/365). Upon successful completion of the course, you will be able to:  

* LO 1: Interpret data displayed in tables and graphically
* LO 2: Apply concepts of sample space and probability
* LO 3: Calculate measures of central tendency and variation for a given data set
* LO 4: Identify the standard methods of obtaining data and identify advantages and disadvantages of each
* LO 5: Calculate the mean and variance of a discrete distribution
* LO 6: Calculate probabilities using normal and t-distributions
* LO 7: Distinguish the difference between sample and population distributions and analyze the role played by the Central Limit Theorem
* LO 8: Construct and interpret confidence intervals
* LO 9: Determine and interpret levels of statistical significance including p-values
* LO 10: Interpret the output of a technology-based statistical analysis
* LO 11: Identify the basic concept of hypothesis testing including Type I and II errors
* LO 12: Formulate hypothesis tests involving samples from one and two populations
* LO 13: Select the appropriate technique for testing a hypothesis and interpret the result
* LO 14: Use regression lines and ANOVA for estimation and inference, and interpret the associated statistics
* LO 15: Use appropriate statistical techniques to analyze and interpret applications based on data from at least four of the following disciplines:  business, economics, social science, psychology, political science, administration of justice, life science, physical science, health science, information technology, and education


## 3. Central Tendency

Measures of central tendency are averages. They summarize the scores in the distribution in a single number. In statistics, there are different kinds of averages. If we wanted to give a single number to summarize data, what number would we choose? We want the find a middle or typical value. There are three measures to choose from: mean, median, and mode.

## [[Sample Roles and Directives]]

Roles and directives are two of the most powerful tools in Jupyter Book. They
are like functions, but written in a markup language. They both
serve a similar purpose, but **roles are written in one line**, whereas
**directives span many lines**. They both accept different kinds of inputs,
and what they do with those inputs depends on the specific role or directive
that is being called.

Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.
